## 2.6.0 - 2015-07-23

### Added

- [#4](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-servicemanager/pull/4) updates the
    `ServiceManager` to [implement the container-interop interface](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop),
    allowing interoperability with applications that consume that interface.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#3](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-servicemanager/pull/3) properly updates the
  codebase to PHP 5.5, by taking advantage of the default closure binding
  (`$this` in a closure is the invoking object when created within a method). It
  also removes several `@requires PHP 5.4.0` annotations.
